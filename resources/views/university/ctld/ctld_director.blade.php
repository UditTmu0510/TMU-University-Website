                    students by establishing the Centre for Teaching Learning and Development
                    (CTLD). This was really the need of the hour, as the future of any education
                    institution will depend a lot on transforming students who are capable of
                    creativity and innovation for the organisation they work for. Creativity and
                    Innovations are possible when the employees work in teams where members are
                    confident, highly motivated, dedicated, determined while being emotionally &
                    socially intelligent. At CTLD these are the qualities we develop in
                    students.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">As the university not just comprises of students the CTLD
                    department is also responsible for the development of the staff & faculty
                    members through continuous Faculty Development Programmes (FDPs) and staff
                    development programmes (SDP).</p>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">TMU’s CTLD has recruited sufficient master
                    trainers to cater to the training need of university’s more than 1300 employees
                    and more than 14000 students..</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Some of the trainers are specialised in soft, social, emotional skills while
                    others are specialised in quantitative aptitude, reasoning ability and verbal
                    ability along with having a good amount of experience in their field of
                    specialisation.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Dear students, I wholeheartedly welcome all of you to join
                    this world-class University. I assure that we will go all out to prepare you as
