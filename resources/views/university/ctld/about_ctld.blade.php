                    In today&#39;s competitive job market, academic excellence alone is insufficient. Employers increasingly
                    prioritise candidates who exhibit strong soft skills, adaptability, and interpersonal abilities.
                    Recognising this
                    shift, Teerthanker Mahaveer University (TMU) established the Centre for Teaching, Learning &amp;
                    Development (CTLD) to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and essential professional
                    competencies.</p>

                <p class="mb-4 text-justify">CTLD is committed to the holistic development of students, focusing on enhancing
                    quantitative aptitude,
                    logical reasoning, verbal communication, and personality traits. Through structured training programmes,
                    students are equipped to excel in group discussions, personal interviews, and various professional
                    scenarios.
                    These initiatives not only bolster students&#39; confidence but also prepare them to meet the dynamic
                    demands
                    of the corporate world.</p>
               <p class="mb-4 text-justify"> By fostering a culture of continuous learning and personal growth, CTLD ensures that TMU graduates are
                not only academically proficient but also possess the soft skills necessary to thrive in diverse
                professional
                environments.
