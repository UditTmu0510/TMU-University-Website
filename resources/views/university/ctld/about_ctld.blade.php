                    Here’s a hint, it’s not the grades, instead it’s the personality traits. Companies seeking talent don't reject individuals solely based on low domain scores or grades; instead,   they primarily do so due to a lack of basic aptitudes, life skills, soft skills, and social skills.<br>
                    As per the research by one of the world’s top Universities, 88% of a candidate’s selection at hotshot corporates and other dream companies is based on Soft skills and only 12% weighs on domain knowledge in an interview.<br>

                    Hence, realising the importance of these skills, Teerthanker Mahaveer University (TMU) introduced
                    new training department which will develop essential basic aptitude skillset in students and faculty
                    members, thus forming <strong>Centre for Teaching Learning and Development (CTLD).</strong><br>
                    CTLD focuses on developing quantitative ability, reasoning ability, verbal ability and developing
                    the personality of the students by encouraging and nurturing their soft skills, so as to be
                    productive to meet the demands of the employers and clearing the placement interview which will pave
                    the way to their dream company. These training programmes also upgrade the students' social and
                    professional skills which are required for their future workspace.
