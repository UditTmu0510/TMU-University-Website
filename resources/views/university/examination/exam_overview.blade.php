						<p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">The examination system is based on a continuous evaluation of the students performance
							on different parameters. Most of the programmes of the University are based on semester system
							except wherever the University authorities and statutory bodies decide otherwise. The continuous
							evaluation is both internal and external. While the internal evaluation comprises of two internal
							mid semester examinations, projects, assignments, tutorials and attendance, the end semester
							examination is fully external for ensuring fair assessment of the students competence.</p>
						<p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">A student is eligible for the award of University degree if he/she has undergone the
							regular course of studies, completed the project report/dissertation specified in the course
							curriculum within the stipulated time and have secured the minimum credits and percentage of marks
							needed for the award of concerned degree as per the University ordinances. For details relating to
							examinations the students are advised to go through the University Ordinance available at University
							website.</p>
