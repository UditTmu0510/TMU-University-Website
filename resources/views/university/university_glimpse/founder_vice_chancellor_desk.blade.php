                                    The challenge before the educationists today is to channelize the intelligent,
                                    creative and enthusiastic youth of the country into the <span
                                        class="highlight">nation building process</span>. I strongly believe that right
                                    mix of education focusing on <span class="highlight">head, heart and hand</span> can
                                    substantially help in meeting this challenge. The need therefore is to <span
                                        class="highlight">reorient education</span> that concentrates on the development
                                    of <span class="highlight">right attitude, knowledge and skill set</span> of the
                                    students and that is what we are concentrating upon here. In recent past interactive

                                    issues confronting the industries and their solutions, besides providing larger
                                    avenues for training and placement.</p>

                                    The facilities and the efforts to promote research activities in the university have
                                    started yielding satisfactory results whereby in the last one year <span
                                        class="highlight">210 quality research papers have been published</span>. We are
                                    further consolidating the research base by adding more research labs and
                                    collaborating with industries and academia.</p>

                                    Similarly, a beginning has been made towards <span class="highlight">consultancy by

                                    Development Centre, New Delhi. I am confident that these initiatives shall
                                    sufficiently groom the students to acquire the required competencies to smoothly
                                    sail through their journey of <span class="highlight">personal and professional
