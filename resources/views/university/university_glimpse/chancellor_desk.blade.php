                            It is my firm belief that the harmonious development of society can be achieved by
                                    <span class="highlight p-0">the enlightenment of the individual heart, mind and soul</span>.
                                    This has become a prerequisite in todayâ€™s fast-changing world where material gains
                                    have outpaced basic human values. I am of the firm opinion that education as a
                                    powerful instrument of socioeconomic change can transform the attitude, thinking
                                    and lifestyle of the people and society. <span class="highlight p-0">Education enables
                                        flexible thinking and enhances better decision making capabilities in

                                I have always dreamt of empowering society with enlightened, skilful and
                                    socially relevant citizens, which can be possible only by educating the masses. As
                                    such, we have undertaken in this noble task of reconstructing the social order by
                                    providing educational establishments, thus contributing to the development of the nation
                                    in our own humble way. <span class="highlight p-0">Teerthanker Mahaveer University has
                                    embraced the task of developing human capital in tune with the requirements of

                                    encouraging environment that provides adequate liberty for individual ambition and
