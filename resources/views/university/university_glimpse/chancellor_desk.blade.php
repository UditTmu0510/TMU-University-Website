                                    It is my firm belief that the harmonious development of society can be achieved by
                                    <span class="highlight">the enlightenment of the individual heart, mind and soul</span>.
                                    This has become a prerequisite in today’s fast-changing world where material gains
                                    have out-placed basic human values. I am of the firm opinion that education as a
                                    powerful instrument of socioeconomic change can transform the attitude, thinking
                                    and lifestyle of the people and society. <span class="highlight">Education enables
                                        flexible thinking and better decision making capabilities in
                                        individuals</span>.<br></p>
