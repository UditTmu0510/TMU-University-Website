                    student’s success. Legal education has changed drastically over the past ten years in terms of
                    what needs to be taught to meet the needs of the legal market. As litigation is no more centric
                    on legal education, there is a huge challenge for our faculty members to produce lawyers who can
                    go beyond the traditional practice of law.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Implementing traditional curricula is not sufficient. Our law college
                        broadens its academic horizon by introducing new legal disciplines preparing our students for
                        the expanding and challenging market. In addition, we train our students in the research skills
                        necessary for today’s practice.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Our faculty members deeply care about the success of our students. They
                        are always ready to provide academic and other support needed. We prepare our students to serve
                        their clients with excellence. I welcome you to the College of Law and Legal Studies and be part
                        of future legal education which is professionally and intellectually rewarding.</p>
