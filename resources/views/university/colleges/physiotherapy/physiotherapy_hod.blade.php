Keeping the very fact in mind the department with the support of it's able faculty members, visionary management and excellent and extensive infrastructure entrenches perseverance and a never-say-die spirit from academics to co-curricular activities in the heart of every student to not only making them good physiotherapists but brilliant human beings.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Physiotherapists are key players in the health care system today. They help in restoring and improving movements, keeping patients healthy, fit and active thereby improving the quality of life. They also play an important role in avoiding surgery and long term use of medications.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Besides the class room learning and clinical training at the 1000 bedded Teerthanker Mahaveer Hospital and Research Centre, our outreach programs such as physiotherapy camps in the rural areas serving the poor and weaker sections of the society,</p>
