As rightly said by Albert Einstein, "Education is not learning of facts but training of mind to think". Keeping this very very fact in mind the department with the support of its able faculty members, visionary management and excellent and extensive infrastructure entrenches perseverance and a never-say-die spirit from academics to co-curricular activities in the heart of every student to not only make them good physiotherapists but brilliant human beings.</p>
                <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">Physiotherapists are key players in the  healthcare system today. They help in restoring and improving movements, keeping patients healthy, fit and active thereby improving the quality of life. They also play an important role in avoiding surgery and long-term use of medications.</p>
                <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">Besides the classroom learning and clinical training at the 900+ bedded Teerthanker Mahaveer Hospital and Research Centre, our outreach programmes such as physiotherapy camps in the rural areas serving the poor and weaker sections of society,</p>
