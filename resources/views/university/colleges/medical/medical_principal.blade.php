                        world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls. Where words come out from
                        the depth of truth, where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection. Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
                         Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever widening thought and action. Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, LET MY COUNTRY AWAKE!<span class="highlight fs-14">Rabindranath Tagore</span></p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">Today I feel honoured to serve as the Principal of this prestigious college
                        Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College & Research Centre, which was established in 2008 with the
                        entry of only 100 students for MBBS which was increased within a very short time to 150 students
                        during the year 2014-15. The ladder of success has been constant and rather very fast for the
                        Post Graduate seats also. There are 126 Post Graduate seats in different Pre, Para & Clinical
                        subjects.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">I have been given opportunities to sharpen my skills and knowledge to excel as a
                        facilitator and a good organiser. It is now my turn to motivate faculty members to impart
                        Knowledge and practical skills to students in becoming a perfect doctor. The two qualities also needed to pursue graduation and post graduation in any branch
                        of Medicine to serve the society is to have sympathy and empathy for patients and their
                        relatives.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2"> My message to all staff and students is to have love and respect for all, move
                        forward with purpose and passion.Medicos should never forget society has great expectation from them.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">Respect, care, discipline and punctuality are the mandatory qualities to enhance not
                        only our image but also to transform our college into a centre of excellence</p>
