                    <p class="about-p mb-4">Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology is a unique amalgamation of
                        Oral Medicine and Radiology. It acts as a bridge between dentistry and medicine. It provides
                        specialized training in clinical care for managing head and neck medical diseases. As the
                        old medical acronym goes; “Oral cavity is the mirror of all systemic diseases”, thus
                        reflecting the earliest evidences of systemic pathologies and Oral Physicians play a major
                        role in identifying these symptoms, managing these conditions to give a better prognosis.
