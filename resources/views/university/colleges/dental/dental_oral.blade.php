                            <li>Beauty is Skin Deep is a proverb that has been proved wrong... it is at least deep to the bone. Orthognathic Surgery is a branch of OMFS that aims to correct under grown, over grown or asymentric jaw and enhance the beauty of an individual by correcting the jaw bones.</li>
                            <li>The department has been involved in orthognathic surgery and is one of the best centers for quality treatment.</li>

                            <li>Dental implants, the state of the art modality to replace missing teeth can be of little help when one is lost due to trauma. This opened up a new area of interest in bone grafts in these patients for dental implants.</li>
                            <li>Autogenous, alloplastic and homogenous bone grafts are being done and later implants are placed to totally rehabilitate patients with maxillofacial trauma.</li>
