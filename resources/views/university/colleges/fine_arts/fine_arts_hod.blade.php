                        esteemed creative fields in the industry, like Advertising, Art Direction, Interface Design,
                        E-learning, Web Design, Exhibition Design, Product Design, Merchandising, Branding, Motion
                        Graphics, Photography, Profession Artist, Teaching in Art Profession etc.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify text-dark fs-14 mb-2">Many of our students pursue higher education and get admitted to internationally acclaimed
                        design institutions in India as well as abroad. This shows the commitment of our staff as well
                        as students towards imparting international education to provide global career for our students.</p>

                    management and participation of staff and students in the endeavor towards excellence.</p>
