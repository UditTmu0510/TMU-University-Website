                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">Pharmacy is a noble profession and the pharmacist plays a vital role in the health
                    care profession. In the new global scenario, college has set its eyes on a vision to be ahead of
                    others in imparting knowledge, skills and training the future pharmacists, thereby, catering to
                    the needs of industries, academia, patient care and drug regulatory affairs at global level.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">The college curriculum has been carefully crafted to expose students to life-like
                    professional situations, thereby, equipping them for the dynamic professional world. The college
                    provides this edge to students by including professional case studies, summer training and
                    Industrial visits in the curriculum.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">We strongly believe that imparting good education is about good faculty, eager
                    students and an open learning environment. We are highly focused on each of these areas. We also
                    believe that education is not only about teaching curriculum, but it is also about the
                    development of human intellect and training the thought process to face unprecedented situations
                    with confidence.</p>
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">I have immense faith in the practices the college ensures to teach students the true
                    essence of being a healthcare professional. We have seen and shaped professionals that have made
                    significant contributions to the nursing profession and positively impact the lives of countless
                    individuals.</p>
                <p class="mb-1"> College of Pharmacy is about teaching and reaching out to each one of our students
                    and acknowledging their individual capabilities and constraints. We have an intimate learning
                    environment, where the faculty is engaged and accessible to each of our students. We constantly
                    and tirelessly support our students through their learning curve, while sharing their joys and
                    learning along with them. We teach, counsel and through numerous student activities we impart
                    life skills in our students. </p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-justify">There are lot of student activities like various clubs and other forums that are managed by students.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p class="mb-2 text-justify">The students continuously motivate and challenge each other's mental boundaries to help each other to grow.
                    We encourage our students to speak their mind and always teach them to have an open channel to exchange ideas and thought, thus, our students are not shy to express their ideas and think creatively.
                    The students follow hobbies of their choice as these things too shape them as an individual.</p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Thus, the time one spends at SOP is an exciting journey to learn, to make lifelong friends, to differentiate between what one knows and what one doesn't â€“ also about knowing where to go and find what one needs to know and having got it; knowing how to use the learning.</p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-justify">This we believe is wholesome education - truly an experience If you are looking for a learning experience beyond just text books, come be part of this legacy that will make you feel proud and help you excel in the professional world that awaits you.</p>
