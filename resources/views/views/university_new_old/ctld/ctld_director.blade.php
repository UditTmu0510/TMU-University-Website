                    students by establishing the Centre for Teaching Learning and Development
                    (CTLD). This was really the need of the hour, as the future of any education
                    institution will depend a lot on transforming students who are capable of
                    creativity and innovation for the organisation they work for. Creativity and
                    Innovations are possible when the employees work in teams where members are
                    confident, highly motivated, dedicated, determined while being emotionally &
                    socially intelligent. At CTLD these are the qualities we develop in

                    members through continuous Faculty Development Programmes (FDPs) and staff
                    development programmes (SDP).</p>
