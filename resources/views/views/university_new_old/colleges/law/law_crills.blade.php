                        <p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">Teerthanker Mahaveer Universityâ€™s College of Law and Legal Studies has introduced a novel platform popularly known as CRILLS.

                    <div class="container p-3">
                        <p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">The Center holds seminars, conferences, and workshops on several legal subjects, thus benefiting the legal community at large. It also intends to pursue interdisciplinary study in fields such as law and society, law and medicine, law and economics, and so on.</p>
                        <p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">Being a modern law school, we have the advantage of framing a modern curriculum with technologically supported higher legal education pedagogy aiming at honing skill sets most appropriate for lawyers. Our students have interned in different fields of practice during their winter and summer internship periods.</p>
                        <p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">Furthermore, the Center publishes an E-Newsletter in Harvard style, primarily administered by student editors and overseen by academic editors. The newsletter contains updates on legal news and events, as well as accomplishments and opportunities that occur during the year.</p>
                        <p class="about-p mb-4 text-justify">In the future, CRILLS will aim to announce the launch of the TMU Law Review. It will be a student-edited law magazine that aims to publish leading research articles and notes written by legal experts from throughout the country to contribute to the growth of law and serve as a research tool for practitioners, academics, and students.</p>
