All through the process, students are guided by dedicated faculty mentors as well as mentor from the organization. To evaluate the student, the faculty mentor, in contact with the industry mentor, monitors the studentâ€™s progress.
                                    This practical approach ensures that our students graduate with hands-on experience, knowledge, and skills sought by employers worldwide.</p>
